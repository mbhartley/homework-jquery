The Iron Yard Academy Week 2

After the initial lecture on JQuery, I was given the following assignment: create 30 examples of JQuery. We had
recently been working with CSS transitions, so my (very green) understanding of JQuery at the time was that it
would primarily be useful for animation effects, and many of my examples simply use the addClass() method. The
biggest challenge, believe it or not, was coming up with 30 unique examples of JQuery- animating shapes,
hiding images, highlighting text, etc. It was an enjoyable assignment, and one that I will probably re-visit 
after the end of the course. I'm pretty sure I could create a much more diverse set of 30 by now!
